# CyberBugWars
A multiplayer .io online game made by HTML5 p5js Nodejs and socket.io (no game engine is used).
In this game, you have to collect as much as bugs to your colony to win the game before others.
Playable: [https://antclone.herokuapp.com/](https://itch.io/jam/wowie-jam-2)

## Game is made for the 2020 WOWIE Game Jam: https://itch.io/jam/wowie-jam-2
Made in 3 days.
THE GAME HAS LOTS OF BUGS BELIEVE ME :D

## About the making
This game is made using P5js WebGL canvas, everything about the drawing is happening on the client side, and all the logic, movement, and collisions are coded on the server side, so no cheating is possible, all the data is transferred using socket.io connection (if you want to use ws socket, so you have to stringify the objects first before sending).
The design is all done by HTML5 and inline CSS, because it was made in 3 days so couldn't put more time.

## How to run:
1) Install nodejs
2) Install libraries (express, socket.io, victorjs)
3) Type (npm install) in the terminal
4) Run the server using (node server/app.js) in the terminal
5) Open the page on localhost://port (the port is 2000)
